House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques kaggle competition
# Summary
This is an entry for the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). It was initiated for an opportunity to work on Regression problem, using the Scikit-learn framework.
# Things I learnt from this project
* Every missing values are not necessry a missing values, Sometimes the missing values always gives some type of information.
* It is important to see the skewness of target variable as well as features to get a better performance.
* It is also necessary to see the correlation between the features because sometimes some features are highly correlated and act as a twin brothers.
* I have noticed, if the learning rates are high then we need to increase the number of estimators(n_estimators).
# Technologies Used
* Jupyter Notebook
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Scipy
